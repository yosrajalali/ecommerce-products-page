## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

While the current version of the project includes several key features, there are still areas that I plan to focus on for further improvement and expansion in the future. Here are some of the pages and features that I intend to work on:

### Pages to Be Developed

- **Collection Page**: I'll be dedicating time to create a dynamic collection page that showcases an array of products across categories. This will allow visitors to explore and discover products more effectively.

- **Women's Section**: A dedicated area featuring products tailored for women. I'll be refining the user experience to ensure that it resonates with the intended audience.

- **Men's Section**: Similarly, I'll be crafting a men's section that highlights products designed for men. This section will have its own unique look and feel.

- **About Us**: The "About Us" page will receive attention to provide a comprehensive overview of the brand, its story, and its values.

- **Contact Page**: I'm planning to redesign the contact page, making it more user-friendly and accessible. Visitors will have an easier time reaching out and engaging with the brand.

These are the specific pages that I'll be dedicating my efforts to enhance in the frontend development of the portfolio e-commerce website.
